# Raven Starter Project (alpha v0.1)

<img src="assets/documentation/logo/horizontal.png" width="100%" alt="Raven Framework Logo">

A starter repository for building your first Raven Framework application. This project includes example applications to help you get started quickly with pre-built code demonstrating essential components, patterns, and features for building gaze-based applications for Raven Smart Glasses.

For detailed documentation, component reference, and API details, see the [Raven Framework repository](https://github.com/RavenResonance/raven-framework).

## Start your first project

**Step 1:** Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10 or higher** - Download and install from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed
- **Git** - Required to get the Raven Framework (this makes it easy to update later)

To check your Python version, run `python --version` or `python3 --version`. To upgrade Python, download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

**Step 2:** Open a terminal: macOS (Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter), Windows (Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter), or Linux (Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`).

**Step 3:** Clone this starter project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RavenResonance/raven-starter-project.git
cd raven-starter-project
```

**Step 4:** Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv raven-app-venv
```

**Note:** Use `python3` instead of `python` if needed on your system.

**Step 5:** Activate the virtual environment:
- **macOS/Linux:** `source raven-app-venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:** `raven-app-venv\Scripts\activate`

**Step 6:** Clone the Raven Framework and install it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RavenResonance/raven-framework.git 
cd raven-framework
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

**Note:** You might need to use `pip3 install -e .` instead of `pip install -e .` depending on your system.

**Step 7:** Try the Hello World example:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or `python3 main.py` depending on your system.

Now open the project in your editor of your choice like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).

**Step 8:** Know what you are seeing:

- **Your cursor simulates eye gaze**: When you move your mouse cursor, it represents where you're looking with your eyes on the actual glasses. The framework tracks this gaze position to interact with UI elements.
- **Click simulates interaction methods**: Clicking with your mouse simulates the actual interaction methods used on glasses, such as double blink or dwell-to-click (gazing at an element for a set duration).
- **Black appears transparent**: Note that black colors appear transparent due to additive blending, which is how the waveguide display works. The display adds light to what you see in the real world, so pure black cannot be displayed. [Learn more about additive blending and color](https://github.com/RavenResonance/raven-framework/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#color--waveguide).
- **Show Simulator button**: Click on "Show Simulator" to see a preview of how your app will look on the actual waveguide display, including the additive blending effects.
- **Closing windows**: You can close (X out of) either the main app window or the simulator window at any time. You can also move them around by dragging.
- **Exiting the app**: You can also click the home icon in the top right corner of the app window to exit and return to the home screen.

**Step 9:** Know the code:

Key concepts:
- Define a class that inherits from `RavenApp` - this is required for all Raven applications
- Name your main entry point file as `main.py`
- Use `RunApp.run()` to run the class you defined
- You get a 640x640 container called `self.app` that you can add widgets to
- You can create containers (like `VerticalContainer`) and add them to `self.app`
- You can add elements like buttons and text boxes to containers

Here's the Hello World example with comments explaining each line:

```python
# Import the necessary components from the Raven Framework
from raven_framework import RavenApp, RunApp, TextBox, VerticalContainer

# Define your app class, inheriting from RavenApp
class HelloWorld(RavenApp):
    # Initialize the app
    def __init__(self, parent=None) -> None:
        # Call the parent class constructor
        super().__init__(parent)
        # Create a vertical container with a width of 640 pixels
        vbox = VerticalContainer(width=640)
        # Create a text box with "Hello, World!" text, width 640, centered alignment
        text_box = TextBox("Hello, World!", width=640, alignment="center")
        # Add the text box to the vertical container
        vbox.add(text_box)
        # Add the container to the main app window (self.app is the main 640x640 container where all your content should be added to)
        self.app.add(vbox)

# Entry point - run the app when this script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Launch the app using RunApp.run() with empty app_id and app_key for simulator mode
    RunApp.run(lambda: HelloWorld(), app_id="", app_key="")
```

**Example: Adding a button**

```python
from raven_framework import RavenApp, RunApp, Button, VerticalContainer

class MyApp(RavenApp):
    def __init__(self, parent=None) -> None:
        super().__init__(parent)
        vbox = VerticalContainer(width=640)
        # Create a button with text
        button = Button(center_text="Click Me")
        # Set what happens when the button is clicked
        button.on_clicked(self.on_button_click)
        vbox.add(button)
        self.app.add(vbox)
    
    # Define the click handler function
    def on_button_click(self):
        print("Button was clicked!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    RunApp.run(lambda: MyApp(), app_id="", app_key="")
```

**Example: Creating a repeat routine**

```python
from raven_framework import RavenApp, RunApp, Routine, TextBox, VerticalContainer

class MyApp(RavenApp):
    def __init__(self, parent=None) -> None:
        super().__init__(parent)
        vbox = VerticalContainer(width=640)
        # Create a text box to display the counter
        self.counter_text = TextBox("Counter: 0", width=640, alignment="center")
        vbox.add(self.counter_text)
        self.app.add(vbox)
        
        # Initialize counter
        self.counter = 0
        
        # Create a routine that repeats every 1000ms (1 second)
        self.routine = Routine(
            interval_ms=1000,  # Run every 1000 milliseconds
            invoke=self.update_counter,  # Call this function each time
            mode="repeat"  # Repeat mode (runs continuously)
        )
    
    # Function called by the routine
    def update_counter(self):
        self.counter += 1
        self.counter_text.set_text(f"Counter: {self.counter}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    RunApp.run(lambda: MyApp(), app_id="", app_key="")
```

**Step 10:** Explore the [example applications](#example-applications) to see more complex implementations.

**Step 11:** You can skim through the [full Raven Framework documentation](https://github.com/RavenResonance/raven-framework) to understand all available components and features.

**Step 12:** Building apps with AI: The Raven Framework repository includes an `AGENTS.md` file that contains condensed documentation optimized for AI assistants. Coding tools like Cursor and Copilot should automatically see this as a README and use it for context. You can also copy this file and provide it to AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to help you build Raven applications. The AI will have all the framework information it needs to generate code and answer questions about components, sensors, and utilities. [Learn more about AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/).

**Step 13:** Start building your own Raven application in `main.py` in the root directory!

## Running on Raven Glasses

To deploy and run apps on Raven Glasses, use:

```bash
python main.py deploy
```

Or `python3 main.py deploy` depending on your system.

Make sure to provide your `app_id` and `app_key` in the `RunApp.run()` call:

```python
RunApp.run(
    lambda: YourApp(), 
    app_id="your_app_id", 
    app_key="your_app_key"
)
```

**Note:** Use `python3` instead of `python` if needed on your system.
